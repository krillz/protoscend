    It's been our goal to get this web tool available to the gym for some time now.
    In order to have it ready and accessible for setting this summer, we've shoved off some quality of life features, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>advanced setting metrics (this page) for an overall status of the gym</li>
    <li>events tracking</li>
    <li>auto-generation of route labels</li>
    <li>and more!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We appreciate your patience and would absolutely <b>love</b> any feedback or suggestions!
  </p>
